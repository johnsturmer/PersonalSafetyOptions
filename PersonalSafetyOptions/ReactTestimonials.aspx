                    <h3>I am the Program Librarian for the Beacon Falls Public Library in Beacon Falls , Connecticut . 
                        In June, 2011 I hosted a Women's Self Defense Workshop that was conducted by instructor 
                        Rick C. of Senshido Connecticut. I as well as the other participants were extremely impressed with 
                        the instructor's professionalism and attention to detail. The R.E.A.C.T. method he taught was unlike 
                        anything any of the participants had ever been exposed to and as a result they had a considerable number 
                        of questions and potential scenarios that they threw at him. He was able to answer the wide range of 
                        questions to everyone's satisfaction. Rick was also a good sport by being a human punching bag? 
                        giving the participants a chance to practice this concept including throwing elbows and knees.<br /> 

                        The nature of why women need to learn self defense can create a tense atmosphere where women are 
                        too nervous to ask questions or really absorb the information. Rick was courteous and humorous and 
                        went out of his way to make the participants feel comfortable. He is a highly effective instructor and 
                        I'm looking forward to hosting another seminar with Senshido Connecticut.

                    <h3>I have been training in martial arts for over 8 years and have attended a number of self defense seminars, and the Senshido principles are some of the most practical I've seen to date. It not only turns the attacker into a defender in a matter of seconds, it also attacks the very thing every living creature holds dear: the senses needed for survival.
                        <br />
                        Rick C. brings a unique blend of personality, enthusiasm and perhaps most importantly, real world experience to the class he teaches. He has a true desire for the student's to fully grasp and embrace the concepts being taught.
                        <br />
                        As a stand alone system or as an addition to any self defense program/class, the concepts of Senshido and Rick provide a dynamic and powerful combination which I had the privilege of witnessing first hand.

                    <h3>Senshido delivers as promised; a highly-effective combative tool that doesn't require hundreds of hours of training time to attain proficiency. As a lifetime martial artist and professional in the tactical training industry I am skeptical of spin-off fighting styles that promise real-world effectiveness but come up short. Senshido has proven to be an excellent addition to a fighter's skill set as well as a readily-learned core of skills for the new combatives student. The control techniques it has developed allow for the user to defend across the entire use-of-force spectrum, from rape defense to weapon retention.  Thank you Senshido Connecticut for a great seminar and a concept that belongs in everyone's 'toolbox'!

                    <h3>As a self described professional defensive training student and training junkie ( as well as a full time police officer for almost 30 years ) I have had the opportunity to train with some of the biggest names in the industry. Some were exceptional learning experiences and others left a lot to be desired. I have had the pleasure of training under Rick on a number of occasions and can highly recommend him to anyone who is truly serious about defensive training. His level of knowledge is only surpassed by his passion for the subject he teaches. Take a training class with Rick, you can't go wrong.
