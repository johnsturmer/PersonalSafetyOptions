                    <h3>I am the Program Librarian for the Beacon Falls Public Library in Beacon Falls , Connecticut . 
                        In June, 2011 I hosted a Women's Self Defense Workshop that was conducted by instructor 
                        Rick C. of Senshido Connecticut. I as well as the other participants were extremely impressed with 
                        the instructor's professionalism and attention to detail. The R.E.A.C.T. method he taught was unlike 
                        anything any of the participants had ever been exposed to and as a result they had a considerable number 
                        of questions and potential scenarios that they threw at him. He was able to answer the wide range of 
                        questions to everyone's satisfaction. Rick was also a good sport by being a human punching bag? 
                        giving the participants a chance to practice this concept including throwing elbows and knees.<br /> 

                        The nature of why women need to learn self defense can create a tense atmosphere where women are 
                        too nervous to ask questions or really absorb the information. Rick was courteous and humorous and 
                        went out of his way to make the participants feel comfortable. He is a highly effective instructor and 
                        I'm looking forward to hosting another seminar with Senshido Connecticut.
