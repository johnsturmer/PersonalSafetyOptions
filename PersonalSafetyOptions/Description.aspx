                        This class meets the CT Pistol Permit Class requirement mandated by CT Statutes.
Obtain the Knowledge, Skills and Attitude to own and use a pistol safely.  This is a requirement to obtain a CT permit to carry pistols and revolvers.  We have a unique approach, where our students are active, rather than sitting in a chair being lectured to.  We will cover among other things:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Safety</li>
                            <li>Operation of Semi-Automatic Pistols and Revolvers</li>
                            <li>Fundamentals of shooting</li>
                            <li>Range safety and protocol</li>
                            <li>Ammunition</li>
                            <li>Firearms Selection</li>
                            <li>Live Fire</li>
                        </ul>
                        The class is 8 hours long.  Classes take place alternately in Stratford, Wilton, or Bristol.  Live fire is conducted in Bridgeport when we are in Stratford, Norwalk when we are in Wilton, and in Bristol for our Bristol classes.  Class includes safety equipment, ammunition, use of firearms, range time and course materials.

                        R.E.A.C.T. ( Rapid Engagement Assault Counter Tactic  aka: The Shredder ) is an extreme close quarters combat concept.
                        It is based on both human physiology and psychology as it utilizes and exploits your natural defensive reactions, 
                        and therefor is not dependent on speed, size or strength.  
                        The R.E.A.C.T. concept forces an instant reversal of the predator / prey relationship.  The concept can be used for 
                        a wide range of 'use of force' situations, from merely controlling a belligerent contact to defending yourself in 
                        a life or death conflict. Because this primal concept is a natural human reaction, it does not require years to learn.
                        In mere hours a student can have a functional tool to protect themselves in any situation. The R.E.A.C.T. concept 
                        is not graceful or pretty.  It is however effective in the real world, and that makes it beautiful!
